EDA

-> what is the problem? NER & Q&A (i think)

Data
some preprocessing is required
missing data & errors -> text generation?
some are not tagged or labelled

data augmentation: nlpaug


choose a set of high performing models
optimize those models

explore ensembling early: reserve 10% for optimizing and use it to train the optimizer???

test the effect by retraining deberta on 90% of the data and see the effect on CV

once we have good models, ensemble

optimise the ensemble - accelerate the data frame operations using cuDF???? Send podcast to wilson
